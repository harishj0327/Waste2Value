# ♻ Waste to Value – Complete Project Overview

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Waste management is one of the most critical challenges in today’s world. Unsegregated and untreated waste often ends up in landfills, polluting the environment and harming health. At the same time, recyclable waste has economic value if properly collected and sold.

Currently, there is a gap:

* **Customers** don’t know where to sell their waste.
* **Recycling shops/buyers** struggle to source waste directly.
* **Market rates** for waste are not transparent to sellers.

**Waste to Value** bridges this gap through a digital marketplace.
